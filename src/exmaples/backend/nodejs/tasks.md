In Node.js, the event loop processes tasks and microtasks in a specific order. The Task Queue and Microtask Queue are two key components of this process. Here's an example to illustrate how tasks and microtasks are queued and executed in Node.js.

```javascript
// Example of Task Queue and Microtask Queue in Node.js

console.log('Start of the script');

// Task 1 - Synchronous code
console.log('Task 1 - Synchronous code');

// Task 2 - setTimeout (macro task)
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Task 2 - setTimeout');
}, 0);

// Task 3 - fs.readFile (macro task)
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile(__filename, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  console.log('Task 3 - fs.readFile');
});

// Task 4 - setImmediate (macro task)
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Task 4 - setImmediate');
});

// Task 5 - Process.nextTick (micro task)
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Task 5 - process.nextTick');
});

// Task 6 - Promise (micro task)
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Task 6 - Promise');
});

console.log('End of the script');

// Output:
// Start of the script
// Task 1 - Synchronous code
// End of the script
// Task 5 - process.nextTick
// Task 6 - Promise
// Task 2 - setTimeout
// Task 3 - fs.readFile
// Task 4 - setImmediate
```

In this example:

- Task 1 represents synchronous code executed immediately.
- Task 2, Task 3, and Task 4 are macro tasks scheduled in the Task Queue.
- Task 5 and Task 6 are micro tasks scheduled in the Microtask Queue.

The order of execution is as follows:

1. Synchronous code is executed first.
2. Micro tasks (process.nextTick and Promise) are executed before the next cycle of the event loop.
3. Macro tasks (setTimeout, fs.readFile, and setImmediate) are executed in the order they were scheduled.

Understanding the task and microtask queues is crucial for writing efficient and responsive Node.js applications, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.


In the Node.js event loop, microtasks are executed in a single tick, right after the current operation and before the next event loop cycle. This ensures that microtasks are processed before any additional I/O events, timers, or other macro tasks.

The sequence of execution in a single tick looks like this:

1. **Run Synchronous Code:**
   - Execute any synchronous code in the current context.

2. **Execute Microtasks:**
   - Process **all microtasks** in the Microtask Queue.

3. **Execute Macro Tasks:**
   - Execute any pending macro tasks (timers, I/O events, etc.) scheduled during the current tick.

4. **Check for I/O Events:**
   - Check for new I/O events and schedule corresponding callbacks.

This process repeats for each iteration of the event loop. Microtasks are processed immediately after the current synchronous code completes but before moving on to the next iteration of the event loop.

Here's a quick recap using the terminology commonly associated with the Node.js event loop:

- **Macro Tasks:** Represented by the Task Queue, where tasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O operations are queued.

- **Micro Tasks:** Represented by the Microtask Queue, where tasks like `process.nextTick` and `Promise` callbacks are queued.

By ensuring that microtasks are executed in a single tick, Node.js provides a way to handle small, high-priority tasks efficiently, making the event loop responsive to certain types of asynchronous operations.
